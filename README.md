## Description
Long ago we had IM chat, and Netscape now relive that same functionality and chat with others from around the globe about Dungeons and Dragons. You know you can't talk about it during school because you’re living in the Midwest in the 80-90's and it is still considered satanic! You will be run out of town or blamed for murders if you confess to playing this game. That's right stranger things did not make that part up! That shit happened!  Head online to talk about dnd in a secret, safe space!
